I use BrowserRouting from the react-router-dom package. I am running on a Nginx server and adding the following to /etc/nginx/yourconfig.conf solved it for me:

location / {
  if (!-e $request_filename){
    rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.html break;
  }
}
Which corresponds to adding the following to the .htaccess in case you are running Apache:

Options -MultiViews
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
This also seems to be the solution suggested by Facebook themselves and can be found here.
